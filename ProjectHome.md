Welcome to the _opengauge_ project.  An increasingly valuable collection of utilities for helping one monitor and fine tune their vehicles energy usage.

Two main branches of this project include MPGuino and the OBDuino.  Aptly based off of the name [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/), which served as the base for their creation.

  * **The [MPGuino](http://ecomodder.com/wiki/index.php/MPGuino)** - Designed with accuracy and pre-OBD2 vehicles in mind, it reports all essential energy usage measurements for your car.  It can report instant and tank MPG, remaining miles till the tank is empty, and many other things in between (also in metric).  It is hooked up directly to the vehicle's speed sensor and an injector.  This project is reaching maturity and is now available in [kit](http://store.fundamentallogic.com/ecom/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=22&products_id=463&zenid=d6a8782f89737db94cdb918522f96ba2) form.

  * **The [OBDuino32K](http://code.google.com/p/opengauge/wiki/OBDuino32K)** - designed to hook safely to your vehicles OBD2 port. A port available on cars manufactured after 1996.  Capable of reporting all things available on the MPGuino, with the advantage of reporting other relevant data from the vehicles array of sensors.  This would include Temperatures, Engine Load, Manifold Pressure and others.
